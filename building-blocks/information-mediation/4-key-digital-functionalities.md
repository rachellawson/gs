# 4 Key Digital Functionalities

At a high level, these are the key functionalities that must or should be provided by any software implementation that plays the role of an Information Mediator. These key digital functionalities have been cross-checked and validated with those provided by the OpenHIE community (see [below](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PhAUsLhQnVwqDjnkTIl9XXi7Yghtn1TlBvOEt2aoNEw/edit#heading=h.u90fwae6a84c) for details) and the “OpenHIE” column in the yellow table provides a cross-reference to the corresponding OpenHIE specification.

## **4.1 Summary**

In a nutshell, the Information Mediator building block is responsible for providing (1) a managed facility through which different GovStack BBs and applications may communicate securely with each other and (2) a facility through which applications may publish and subscribe to different events identified by unique message types, enabling more efficient and resilient communication and application design.

Note that the IM is not responsible for manipulating the payloads sent to and from various applications—in a sense, it is both the postal service and the roads/bridges/train tracks—but it does not read the contents of your mail.

## **4.2 Overall design**

GovStack facilitates creation of an ecosystem of applications meant to fulfill different e-governance tasks. Applications are software solutions consisting of some specific part which is actually implementation of some user journeys and a set of standard Building Blocks implementing predefined standardized parts of the job. Different parts of the application interact with each other preferably by means of REST based API. This interaction is built around the API Gateway of the application.

Interaction between applications which are participants of the GovStack ecosystem is implemented by Mediator BB Security Servers. Interaction with software solutions outside of GovStack goes in inward direction through firewall/load balancer/reverse proxy and in outward direction through API Gateway.

### 4.3.2 “Out of Scope” Functional Requirements

Initially, the following table of high-level functional requirements was provided to the Information Mediation working group, but all have since been identified as “out of scope” because they fall into the realm of the Workflow BB or the Security BB.

### **4.3.3 Existing Standards**

#### **4.3.3.1 OpenHIE Comparison**

For comparison with existing specifications, we have engaged with [OpenHIE](https://ohie.org) — a global community focused on health systems interoperability. While the remit of the Information Mediator is domain independent, we have drawn from OpenHIE because (a) a number of the initial use cases are health-related and (b) the OpenHIE community has developed a mature, well-thought-through, multi-stakeholder specification which can serve as an example (though limited) for GovStack’s purposes.

Below are the key Information mediation requirements from their [OHIE architecture specification](https://ohie.org/download/openhie-architecture-specification/). Note that the “GovStack?” column provides a cross-reference back to the above GovStack specifications.

| IOLF-6  | The system should allow for the routing of messages to the appropriate architecture component or external Point-of-Service system. ● Performs orchestration tasks for complex transactions to take the burden off client systems. This orchestration may contact multiple service providers within the HIE on a client’s behalf and compile an appropriate response to return to the client. ● Examples of orchestration could be the execution of a care plan or the validation of elements (such as identifiers or codes) in a message against other service providers within the HIE (e.g., PR, CR, FR, TS). ● Orchestration tasks are those that are required to complete the current transaction and therefore must be executed timeously as the transaction cannot continue without these steps. | Recommended    | KDF2      |                                                     |

#### **4.3.3.2 Gov.UK’s API Management Strategy Document**

In future iterations of this specification, we may take into consideration more broad API-management standards which include multiple domains, such as those proposed by the UK Government in their [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defining-an-api-management-strategy document](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defining-an-api-management-strategy). ****&#x20;
