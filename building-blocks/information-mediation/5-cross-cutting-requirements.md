# 5 Cross-cutting requirements

The cross-cutting requirements described in this section are an extension of the cross-cutting requirements defined in the [Architecture Blueprint document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12b696fHlOAAHygFF5-XxUJkFyFjMIV99VDKZTXnnAkg/edit) and the [Security BB definition](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Jofvxb418iCvKGzCJuOAvSUFF2eMGowJkn5ooe\_k6Y/edit#heading=h.kzsl1mf6mtz8). This section will describe any additional cross-cutting requirements that apply to this building block or differences with the Architecture Blueprint.
